# file, to include the name of the project. The system will try to find this file in the classpath, the user home folder
# (recommended) or the local filesystem.

# List of modules that is loaded. Overloading this list is normally not useful, unless you want to add a custom
# module. Disabling a module can be performed by setting unitils.module.<modulename>.enabled to false.
# If a module's specific dependencies are not found (e.g. hibernate is not in you classpath), this module is not loaded,
# even if it is in this list and the enabled property is set to true. It's therefore not strictly necessary to disable
# any of these modules.
